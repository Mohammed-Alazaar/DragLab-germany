                        Google, Google Adwords will set a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set
                        when a user clicks on a Google-enabled ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and
                        cannot be used to identify you personally. If the user visits certain pages of our website and

                        cannot be tracked through AdWords customer websites. The information collected using the

                        for conversion tracking. Adwords customers can see the total number of users who have clicked on

                        not receive any information that personally identifies users. If you do not wish to participate
                        in tracking, you can reject the setting of a cookie necessary for tracking ‚Äì for example, by
                        setting your browser to disable the automatic setting of cookies or by setting your browser so
                        as to block cookies from the domain "googleleadservices.com". Please note that you must not
                        delete the opt-out cookies if you do not wish measurement data to be recorded. If you have
                        deleted all your cookies in your browser, you must set the relevant opt-out cookie again.
